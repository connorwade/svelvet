# Svelvet
#### In Development
###### No where near ready yet 


## A CMS for Teams

The goal of Svelvet is to make developers, content owners, designers, and QA engineers happy. It is built entirely on Svelte, but the goal is to be interopable with all major frameworks.

## Current Use

You can play with the editor and publisher by creating additional components and adding them to the code base.
